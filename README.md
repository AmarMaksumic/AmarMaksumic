### Hi there, my name is Amar!

#### I'm a second year comp. sci. and comp. engineering student at [Rensselaer Polytechninc Institute](https://rpi.edu/). I listen to pop & kpop, wish I had a VW Golf R with 6MT, and am always up to going out and exploring the world with others. I'm interested in the applications of machine learning, computer vision, and control systems in the automotive industry.

#### One of my side hustles is being the Powertrain Lead at [Rensselaer Motorsport](http://formularpi.org): a Formula Student team based in New York. I am leading the development of RMâ€™s first electric powertrain: a package comprised of an [EMRAX 228](https://emrax.com/e-motors/emrax-228/) motor and a [Cascadia RMS PM100DX](https://stealthev.com/product/rinehart-pm100dx/) motor controller.

#### Another one of my side hustles is helping to revive the [RPI Robotics Club](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/roboticsclub/). I'm an officer who is working on laser tag robots (imagine a bunch of roomba's running around with lasers on their head) and maybeeeeeeeeeeeeee a couch bot in the future (a couch that can drive you around).

#### Lastly, I mentor the [Steel Hawks](https://steelhawks.net), a FIRST Robotics Competition team. Currently, the team is comprised of over 100 high-achieving students. Each year, they come back with an increasing number of awards and a higher ranking in the World's Championship. I primarly help them with tasks related to computer vision and autonomous + teleoperated control systems.

#### ***LIST OF PERSONAL PROJECTS I AM WORKING ON RN:

<ul>
<li>Line - Web app and mobile app for keeping track of user's clothing, shoes, and other items. The user can match and develop outfit sets, and a ML algorithm can rate/edit the sets. </li>
<li>VeZa - A family tree viewer that dynamically adjusts depending on who you center in the tree.
</ul>
